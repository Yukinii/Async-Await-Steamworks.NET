Task Async/Await Steamworks.NET Wrapper
=======

_Steamworks.NET_ is a C# Wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API, it can be used either with Unity or your C# based Application. This project relies on dynamic libraries created by [CSteamworks](https://github.com/rlabrecque/CSteamworks). (Prebuilt and included for ease of use)

_Steamworks.NET_ was designed to be as close as possible to the original C++ API, as such the documentation provided from Valve largely covers usage of _Steamworks.NET_. 
Niceties and C# Idioms can be easily implemented on top of _Steamworks.NET_.

_Steamworks.NET_ currently fully supports Windows, OSX, and Linux in both 32 and 64bit varieties. Currently building against Steamworks SDK 1.36.

Original implies the non async/await codebase and doesn't apply to my code.
